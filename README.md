# Blackjack Console Game

A simple, console-based implementation of the classic Blackjack card game built using Python. This project is an excellent starting point for anyone interested in learning game development, object-oriented programming (OOP), and Python's libraries for simulating card games.

## Features
- Interactive, command-line gameplay
- Player vs Dealer gameplay
- Card deck and shuffle logic
- Basic rules of Blackjack, including splitting and staying
- Win/loss conditions
- Option to replay after a game finishes

## How to Play
1. The game starts with the player receiving two cards, and the dealer also receives two cards (one face-up and one face-down).
2. The player can choose to "Hit" to receive another card or "Stand" to keep their current hand.
3. The goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
4. The dealer must hit until their hand value is at least 17.
5. If the player or dealer exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the round.
6. The player wins if their hand value is higher than the dealer's, and the dealer wins if their hand value is higher than the player's.
7. If both the player and the dealer have the same hand value, it's a tie (push).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required for basic gameplay (everything is implemented using Python's built-in libraries).
